FirstProject-Meginnis-Rodriguez 

Authors: 

Jose Rodriguez and Beethoven Meginnis

Project Summary: 

This project gathers revision data from Wikipedia articles using JSONPath and the MediaWiki API and returns it to users in a readable format. A user will be prompted to input an article title, that is then searched for. Up to 27 revisions including author name, date, and timestamp are given to the user. A GUI had been made using JavaFX.

Build Instructions: 

Please use Gradle as well as corretto-16 JDK. To ensure that JavaFX works, run the application from the Gradle menu.

Warning Rationale:

Private method 'oldConsoleMethod()' is never used: This is left in the Main.java class so that users can revert to using the console method to obtain revisions.
